          Cosmos Spaces looked to be more involved in the ecosystem along with contributing every way we could.
          We have a vision for our validators being community centric.
        </p><p>
          We want to be the voice of the community and truly have synchronist validator and delegator relationship.
        </p><p>
          In addition, Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Omniflix, Comdex, e-Money, Dig and Evmos are exciting opportunities and the timing simply feels appropriate, especially considering we have great DevOps partners supporting us with the intent to expand within the  IBC.
